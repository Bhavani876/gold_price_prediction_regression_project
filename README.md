<h1 align="left">Gold Price Dataset- using Regression model</h1>

<h2 align="left">Project Description:</h2>

###

<p align="left">1. Date (mm/dd/yyyy):This variable represents the date of observation.<br>2. SPX: This variable represents the value of the SPX, which is a stock market index of the 500 largest companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. It's often used as a benchmark for the overall performance of the US stock market.<br>3.GLD: This variable represents the price of gold. Gold prices can be influenced by various factors, including economic conditions, geopolitical events, and supply and demand dynamics.<br>4. USO: This variable represents the United States Oil Fund, which is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the price of oil futures. It provides exposure to the price movements of crude oil.<br>5.SLV: This variable represents the price of silver. Similar to gold, silver prices can be influenced by economic factors, industrial demand, and market speculation.<br>6. EUR/USD: This variable represents the currency pair quotation of the Euro against the US dollar. It indicates the exchange rate between the Euro and the US dollar in the foreign exchange market.<br>With this dataset, you can analyze the relationships and correlations between these variables over time, identify trends and patterns, and potentially make predictions or derive insights about financial markets, commodity prices, and currency exchange rates.</p>

<h2 align="left">Steps-Wise in the Project:</h2>

###

<p align="left">1. Importing Libraries: Begin by importing necessary Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.<br>2. Exploration Dataset: Load the dataset containing user data, including the variables mentioned (Date, SPX, GLD, USO, SLV, EUR/USD), and explore its structure, summary statistics, and any missing values.<br>3. Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, if any, and address any inconsistencies or anomalies in the data.<br>4. Preprocessing: Convert the date column to a datetime format. If necessary, perform feature scaling using techniques like Min-Max scaling or standardization. Label encoding may not be required for this dataset since the variables seem numeric or represent categories directly.<br>5. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the relationships between variables, identify correlations, and uncover insights.<br>6. Model Building: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Then, build a regression model using algorithms like Random Forest Regressor, which can capture complex relationships between variables.<br>7. Predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on the test dataset.<br>8. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and visualize the actual versus predicted values using graphs or plots.</p>
